/* Begin by calling initoptions with your argc-argv pair, a string
 * containing a list of valid options, and an cmdlineinfo structure.
 * In the string listing the valid options, a character can have a
 * colon after it to indicate that the option is to be followed with a
 * value. (If -: is a valid option, put it first in the string.) The
 * cmdlineinfo structure is used when calling readoption, and also
 * contains information about each option (analagous to the extern
 * variables in getopt). After this, call readoption repeatedly to
 * find and identify an option on the command line.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *	initoptions(&opt, "cdL:rnx:", argc - 1, argv + 1);
 *
 * indicates that -c, -d, -r, and -n are legal boolean options, and that
 * -L and -x are legal options that include a value. If the cmdline was:
 *
 *	prog -dLfoo -n bar -x baz
 *
 * then the first three calls to readoption would find -d, -L, and -n
 * with -L having the value "foo" attached to it. Calling readoption a
 * fourth time would find the non-option argument "bar". The fifth
 * call would find -x with "baz" as its accompanying value. A sixth
 * call to readoption would return EOF, indicating the end of the
 * cmdline.
 *
 * Written by Brian Raiter, 1997, with minor modifications 1997-2001.
 * This code is in the public domain.
